# Simple DIY Electronic Music Projects - EuroRack Projects - Source

This repository houses the source for any designs for my EuroRack related Simple DIY Electronic Music Projects - https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/.

Full details are provided in the accompanying blog posts - there should be links from any source files provided here.

#  A Word of Caution!

Please note - I consider myself a novice at electronics and pcb design!

**Don't spend your own time and resources on any of these designs without knowing what you are doing.  They are not "off the shelf products" ready to go!**

These should NOT be used alongside other modules or in expensive racks or connected up to a power supply that you wouldn't be happy to lose.

Be particularly wary about plugging any of the circuits described in these projects into your expensive computers, audio, musical or electronic equipment - you do so at your own risk! And make sure you double check everything first regardless and am content you understand what the circuit is likely to do to your other equipment. My background is embedded software and music, not electronics, so any electronics information I present is on a "well, I found it somewhere on the Internet and it sort of works for me" basis only!

These should only be used with an old, second-hand or hand-me-down rack, power supply, music keyboard, computer or amplification - that is what I use for everything.

# Support
