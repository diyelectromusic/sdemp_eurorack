# Simple DIY Electronic Music Projects - EuroRack Projects

This repository houses the designs for my EuroRack related Simple DIY Electronic Music Projects - https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/.

#  A Word of Caution!

Please note - I consider myself a novice at electronics and pcb design!

**Don't spend your own time and resources on any of these designs without knowing what you are doing.  They are not "off the shelf products" ready to go!**

These should NOT be used alongside other modules or in expensive racks or connected up to a power supply that you wouldn't be happy to lose.

Be particularly wary about plugging any of the circuits described in these projects into your expensive computers, audio, musical or electronic equipment - you do so at your own risk! And make sure you double check everything first regardless and am content you understand what the circuit is likely to do to your other equipment. My background is embedded software and music, not electronics, so any electronics information I present is on a "well, I found it somewhere on the Internet and it sort of works for me" basis only!

These should only be used with an old, second-hand or hand-me-down rack, power supply, music keyboard, computer or amplification - that is what I use for everything.

# Support

I do not offer support for any of these projects, there are provided "as is" (see license).

But I will attempt to answer any queries posted to a public forum.  More here: https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/support/.

# Using my pcbs

These are all developed in KiCad (https://www.kicad.org/) and there should be everything here required to have any of them built should you so wish.  Each project has an "output" directory and that contains all the build files and a combined ZIP file that can be downloaded "raw" and uploaded to your favourite PCB manufacturing site.

IMPORTANT: Be sure to note any additional information in the readme for each project and please read carefully the design and build information from the blog before spending any time or funds on any of these designs as that is where I will have documented my (countless, no doubt) mistakes in the design!

For more context, see https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/pcbs/

*Please also note: I don't sell PCBs.*

These are for my own personal hobby use, but I'm very happy for anyone to take them as inspiration for their own projects (given the warnings, caveats and context above).
