# EuroRack Blank Panels

Designs of a PCB-based front panel for EuroRack modules with built-in GND and VCC rails.

- Design notes: N/A
- Build and test notes: N/A

General Notes:
- VCC and GND are included for convenience but don't have to be used.
- The mounting holes should have been multiples of 1HP (5.08mm) apart.  This panel isn't quite to spec, but as I've used oval mounting holes, there should be enough flexibility to work ok in most cases.
- When drilling holes for mounting components additional care is required if using VCC.

Bill of Materials:
- Panel PCB.

Errata:
- None.

#  A Word of Caution!

Please note - I consider myself a novice at pcb design!

**DO NOT USE with other expensive modules, racks or power supplies.**

These are DIY projects only and I am not qualified to design something that could be used with other commerical, expensive equipment without damaging it.

**Don't spend your own time and resources on any of these designs without knowing what you are doing.  They are not "off the shelf products" ready to go!**
