#  A Word of Caution!

Please note - I consider myself a novice at pcb design!

**DO NOT USE with other expensive modules, racks or power supplies.**

These are DIY projects only and I am not qualified to design something that could be used with other commerical, expensive equipment without damaging it.

**Don't spend your own time and resources on any of these designs without knowing what you are doing.  They are not "off the shelf products" ready to go!**
